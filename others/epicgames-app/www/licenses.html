        <h3><em>Statement of Purpose</em></h3>
        <p>The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
          automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
          (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
          and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or
          a database (each, a "Work").</p>
        <p>Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
          to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
          creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the
          public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
          infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
          reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
          whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
          commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
          Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
          production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
          gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
          through the use and efforts of others.</p>
        <p>For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
          without any expectation of additional consideration or
          compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
          "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
          Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
          to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
          under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
          Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
          effect of CC0 on those rights.</p>
        <p><strong>1. Copyright and Related Rights.</strong>
          A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
          copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
          Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
          are not limited to, the following:
        </p>
        <ol type="i">
          <li>the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
            display, communicate, and translate a Work;</li>
          <li> moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
            performer(s);</li>
          <li>publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
            image or likeness depicted in a Work;</li>
          <li>rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
            to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
            below;</li>
          <li>rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
            reuse of data in a Work;</li>
          <li>database rights (such as those arising under Directive
            96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
            March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
            any national implementation thereof, including any amended
            or successor version of such directive); and</li>
          <li>other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
            throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
            any national implementations thereof.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>2. Waiver.</strong> To the greatest extent
          permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
          Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
          unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
          Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
          and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
          existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
          the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer
          makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
          at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
          successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
          subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
          or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
          enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>3. Public License Fallback.</strong> Should any
          part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
          ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
          preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
          Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
          extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
          affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
          sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
          license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
          in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
          maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
          (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
          future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
          purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
          advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The
          License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
          applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
          License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
          ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
          ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
          License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
          she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
          Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
          associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
          Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
          of Purpose.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Limitations and Disclaimers.</strong></p>
        <ol type="a">

            responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
            permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.</li>
          <li>Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative

        the accuracy of any user contact information provided to Crashlytics. Developer may provide Beta Testers with its
        own EULA for a Beta Application that will be accessed by Beta Testers (&ldquo;Developer EULA&rdquo;); provided that
        the Developer EULA provides terms and conditions consistent with this Agreement and, with respect to Crashlytics,
        no less protective than those terms and conditions set forth in the standard EULA provided in Appendix A (&ldquo;Standard
        EULA&rdquo;). If Developer does not provide a separate Developer EULA to Beta Testers that is applicable to Developer&rsquo;s
        Beta Application, then Developer acknowledges and agrees that such Beta Testers&rsquo; use of the Beta Application
        shall be subject to the Standard EULA. Developer acknowledges and agrees that Crashlytics provides the Standard EULA
        by way of convenience only, and does not represent or warrant that the Standard EULA will be enforceable under, or
        in compliance with, all applicable laws, rules, regulations, or otherwise. Developer acknowledges and agrees that
        the EULA applicable to Developer&rsquo;s Beta Application shall be between Developer and any Beta Tester, and Crashlytics
        shall not be responsible for, and shall not have any liability whatsoever for, such EULA, any application tested
        by a Beta Tester, or for any breach by Developer or any Beta Tester of the terms and conditions of such EULA. The

        allow collection of other information via the Services, including some personally identifiable information (e.g.,
        a user&rsquo;s email address), which allows Developers to communicate with users about the engagement with and functionality
        of their applications and to invite them to become Beta Testers. Developer represents and warrants that Developer
        is collecting information via the Services solely to obtain information about the user engagement with and functionality
        of Developer&rsquo;s applications, and to communicate with users about such engagement and functionality. Developer
        agrees that it will not enable collection of personally identifiable information via the Services unless it is necessary
        to communicate with users about the applications or Developer wishes to invite users to be Beta Testers and the user
        has provided affirmative consent to the collection and use of such information. Subject to and without limiting the
        foregoing, Developer agrees it will not enable collection or use of credit card

        about its users, and (c) that states that such information is disclosed to and processed by third party providers
        like Crashlytics in the manner contemplated by the Services, including, without limitation, disclosure of the use
        of technology to track users&rsquo; activity and otherwise collect information from users. For Developer&rsquo;s
        users in the European Union, Developer shall provide such users with clear notice of, and obtain such users&rsquo;
        consent to, the transfer, storage, and use of their information in the United States and any other country where
        Crashlytics, or any third party service providers acting on its behalf, operates, and shall further notify such users
        that the privacy and data protection laws in some of these countries may vary from the laws in the country where

        Developer bears all responsibility and liability for the legality, accuracy and completeness of the Developer Data
        and Crashlytics&rsquo;s access, possession, distribution, and use thereof, as permitted herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.2 Disclaimers. THE CRASHLYTICS SERVICES, CRASHLYTICS PROPERTIES AND RESULTS ARE PROVIDED &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY
        OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, CRASHLYTICS AND ITS PARENTS, SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, RELATED COMPANIES,
        OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, PARTNERS AND LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, THE &ldquo;CRASHLYTICS
        ENTITIES&rdquo;) MAKE NO WARRANTY (I) THAT THE SERVICES OR RESULTS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR BE UNINTERRUPTED,
        ERROR FREE OR BUGFREE, (II) REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICES, OR (III) THAT
        ANY ERRORS IN THE SERVICES CAN OR WILL BE CORRECTED. THE CRASHLYTICS ENTITIES HEREBY DISCLAIM (FOR THEMSELVES AND
        THEIR SUPPLIERS) ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ORAL OR WRITTEN,
      </p>

      <p>
        INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE AND ALL WARRANTIES ARISING FROM ANY COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE OF TRADE.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.3 Claims Against Crashlytics. Developer will defend Crashlytics from all third party claims, whether actual or alleged
        (collectively, &ldquo;Crashlytics Claims&rdquo;), and will indemnify Crashlytics and hold Crashlytics harmless from
        any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees) resulting
        from such Crashlytics Claims that arise out of Developer&rsquo;s (a) use of the Services, (b) actual or alleged infringement
        or misappropriation of the rights of any third party, including, without limitation, any intellectual property rights,
        privacy rights or publicity rights, and (c) breach of any representations and warranties set forth in the Agreement.
        Developer is solely responsible for defending any such Crashlytics Claims, subject to Crashlytics&rsquo;s right to
        participate with counsel of its own choosing, and for payment of all judgments, settlements, damages, losses, liabilities,
        costs, and expenses, including reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees, resulting from such Claims against Crashlytics,
        provided that Developer will not agree to any settlement related to any such Crashlytics Claims without Crashlytics&rsquo;s
        prior express written consent regardless of whether or not such settlement releases Crashlytics from any obligation
        or liability. If Developer uses the Services in an official capacity as an employee or representative of a United
        States federal, state, or local government entity and is legally unable to accept this indemnification provision,
        then it does not apply to such entity, but only to the extent as required by applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.4Claims Against Developer. Crashlytics will defend the Developer from all third party claims, actions, suits, or proceedings,
        whether actual or alleged (collectively, &ldquo;Developer Claims&rdquo;), and will indemnify Developer and hold Developer
        harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney&rsquo;s
        fees) resulting from such Developer Claims, that arise out of an allegation that the Services, when used as expressly
        permitted by this Agreement, infringes the intellectual property rights of such third party. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, Crashlytics will have no obligation under this Section 4.4 or otherwise with respect to any infringement
        claim based upon: (a) any use of the Services not expressly permitted under this Agreement; (b) any use of the Services
        in combination with products, equipment, software, or data not made available by Crashlytics if such infringement
        would have been avoided without the combination with such other products, equipment, software, or data; (c) any modification
        of the Services by any person other than Crashlytics or its authorized agents or subcontractors; or (d) any claim
        not clearly based on the Services itself. This Section 4.4 states Crashlytics&rsquo;s entire liability and Developer&rsquo;s
        sole and exclusive remedy for all third party claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.5 Procedure. The foregoing obligations are conditioned on the party seeking indemnification: (a) promptly notifying the
        other party in writing of such claim; (b) giving the other party sole control of the defense thereof and any related
        settlement negotiations; and (c) cooperating and, at other party&rsquo;s request and expense, assisting in such defense.
        Neither party may make any
      </p>

      <p>
        public announcement of any claim, defense or settlement without the other party&rsquo;s prior written approval. The indemnifying
        party may not settle, compromise or resolve a claim without the consent of the indemnified party, if such settlement,
        compromise or resolution (x) causes or requires an admission or finding of guilt against the indemnified party, (y)
        imposes any monetary damages against the indemnified party, or (z) does not fully release the indemnified party from
        liability with respect to the claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        4.6 Limitation of Liability. (a) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
        EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES
        ASSOCIATED WITH ANY LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS, PROFITS, OR GOODWILL OR FOR INTERRUPTION, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR
        NETWORKS. (b) IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY&rsquo;S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY AND ALL CLAIMS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
        EXCEED FIFTY ($50.00) DOLLARS (USD). (c) THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL NOT APPLY TO BREACHES OF CONFIDENTIALITY
        OBLIGATIONS OR FOR MISAPPROPRIATION OR INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING
        THE FAILURE OF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED HEREIN. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS AND DISCLAIMERS SHALL APPLY TO ANY
        AND ALL CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON CONTRACT, WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING
        NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
        SUCH LOSS OR DAMAGE. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,
        so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to You. INSOFAR AS APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS ANY LIMITATION ON
        LIABILITY HEREIN, THE PARTIES AGREE THAT SUCH LIMITATION WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY MODIFIED, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT SO
        AS TO MAKE THE LIMITATION COMPLIANT WITH APPLICABLE LAW.
      </p>
      <p>
        SECTION 5. TERM AND TERMINATION
      </p>
      <p>
        5.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will begin on the date you first agree to this Agreement and are approved to register
        for the Services, and continue until terminated as set forth herein (&ldquo;Term&rdquo;). Your use of the Services

        one party to the other party as set forth herein.
      </p>
      <p>
        5.2 Effects of Termination. Upon any expiration or termination of this Agreement, all rights, obligations and licenses of
        the parties shall cease, except that (a) all obligations that accrued prior to the effective date of termination
        and all remedies for breach of this Agreement shall survive, (b) you must discontinue accessing and using the Services
        and delete all Software, Crashlytics Properties, and Crashlytics Material, and (c) the provisions in Section 2 titled

      </p>

        to store, delete or return any User Feedback, Performance Data, Developer Data, or Results.
      </p>
      <p>
        6. MISCELLANEOUS
      </p>
      <p>
        6.1 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (which includes any order form completed by Developer) constitutes the entire agreement,
        and supersede all prior negotiations, understandings, or agreements (oral or written), between the parties about
        the subject matter of this Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.2 Waivers, Consents and Amendments. No waiver, consent, or modification of this Agreement shall bind the Crashlytics Entities
        unless in writing and signed by Crashlytics. Crashlytics may amend this Agreement from time to time. If we make a
        change to this Agreement that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you at the email address that
        you provided upon signing up to access the Services or upon signing up to access the Crashlytics Fabric services,
        at crashlytics.com, or otherwise through the Services. If you do not agree to the modified terms, you shall notify
        Crashlytics in writing within thirty (30) days, after which your right to access and use the Services shall immediately
        terminate and the Crashlytics Entities shall have no further responsibility or liability to you. The failure of either
        party to enforce its rights under this Agreement at any time for any period will not be construed as a waiver of
        such rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.3 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be
        limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in full force
        and effect and enforceable.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.4 Governing Law and Disputes. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
        of California, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.4(b) below,
        all claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services (&quot;Disputes&rdquo;) will be governed
        by California law, excluding California&rsquo;s conflict of laws rules, and all Disputes will be litigated exclusively
        in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, and You and Crashlytics consent to personal
        jurisdiction in those courts. (b) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals)
        is in any country within APAC (other than Australia, Japan, New Zealand or Singapore) or Latin America, this Section
        6.4(b) will apply instead of Section 6.4(a) above. ALL DISPUTES (AS DEFINED ABOVE) WILL BE GOVERNED BY CALIFORNIA
        LAW, EXCLUDING CALIFORNIA&rsquo;S CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES. The parties will try in good faith to settle any Dispute
        within 30 days after the Dispute arises. If the Dispute is not resolved within 30 days, it must be resolved by arbitration
        by the American Arbitration Association&rsquo;s International Centre for Dispute Resolution in accordance with its
        Expedited Commercial Rules in force as of the date of this Agreement (&quot;Rules&quot;). The parties will mutually
        select one arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in English in Santa Clara County, California, USA. Either
        party may apply to any competent court for injunctive relief necessary to protect its rights pending resolution of
        the arbitration. The arbitrator may order equitable or injunctive relief consistent with
      </p>

      <p>
        the remedies and limitations in this Agreement. Subject to the confidentiality requirements in of this Agreement, either
        party may petition any competent court to issue any order necessary to protect that party&#39;s rights or property;
        this petition will not be considered a violation or waiver of this governing law and arbitration section and will
        not affect the arbitrator&rsquo;s powers, including the power to review the judicial decision. The parties stipulate
        that the courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA, are competent to grant any order under this subsection. The
        arbitral award will be final and binding on the parties and its execution may be presented in any competent court,
        including any court with jurisdiction over either party or any of its property. Any arbitration proceeding conducted
        in accordance with this section will be considered Confidential Information under this Agreement&#39;s confidentiality
        section, including (i) the existence of, (ii) any information disclosed during, and (iii) any oral communications
        or documents related to the arbitration proceedings. The parties may also disclose the information described in this
        section to a competent court as may be necessary to file any order under this section or execute any arbitral decision,
        but the parties must request that those judicial proceedings be conducted in camera (in private). The parties will
        pay the arbitrator&rsquo;s fees, the arbitrator&#39;s appointed experts&#39; fees and expenses, and the arbitration
        center&#39;s administrative expenses in accordance with the Rules. In its final decision, the arbitrator will determine
        the non-prevailing party&#39;s obligation to reimburse the amount paid in advance by the prevailing party for these
        fees. Each party will bear its own lawyers&rsquo; and experts&rsquo; fees and expenses, regardless of the arbitrator&rsquo;s
        final decision. (c) If Your principal place of business (for entities) or place of residence (for individuals) is
        in Greece, all Disputes (as defined above) will be governed by Greek law and the parties submit to the exclusive
        jurisdiction of the courts of Athens in relation to any Dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.5 Force Majeure. In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations
        under this Agreement (except payment obligations) due to any cause beyond its reasonable control, the affected party
        shall give written notice thereof to the other party and its performance shall be extended for the period of delay
        or inability to perform due to such occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.6 Notices. Any notice or communication hereunder shall be in writing and either personally delivered or sent via confirmed
        facsimile, confirmed electronic transmission, recognized express delivery courier or certified or registered mail,
        prepaid and return receipt requested, addressed to the other party, which, in the case of Developer, shall be the
        email address provided to Crashlytics upon signing up for the Services or upon signing up to access the Crashlytics
        Fabric services, and, in the case of Crashlytics, shall be Google Inc. 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View,
        CA 94043, USA, with a copy to Legal Department. All notices shall be in English, and deemed to have been received
        when they are hand delivered, or five business days after their mailing, or upon confirmed electronic transmission
        or confirmed facsimile transmission.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.7 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder may not be assigned, transferred or delegated, in
        whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, contract, merger (whether Developer is the surviving
        or disappearing entity), stock or asset sale,
      </p>

      <p>
        consolidation, dissolution, through government action or otherwise, by Developer without Crashlytics&rsquo;s prior written
        consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall automatically be null and void, and Crashlytics
        may immediately terminate this Agreement upon such an attempt. This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to
        the benefit of, any permitted successors, representatives, and permitted assigns of the parties hereto.
      </p>
      <p>
        6.8 Independent Contractors. The parties shall be independent contractors under this Agreement, and nothing herein will constitute
        either party as the employer, employee, agent, or representative of the other party, or both parties as joint venturers
        or partners for any purpose.
